SeReCo is a graduate school gathering researchers from [FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg](https://www.fau.de/), [Karlsruhe Institue of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/), [St. Gallen University](https://www.unisg.ch/), [Mines Saint-Étienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/) and [Jean Monnet University](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/).

The scientific purpose of the SeReCo graduate school is to explore the synergy between Web Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We are focusing, on the one hand, on semantic technologies to provide machines with the possibility to reason on the digital contents made available on the Web, and, on the other hand, on the coordination technologies to provide machines with the possibility to collaboratively operate on the ever increasing set of deployed services.

Our research topics include:
- Semantic data modeling: Linked Data, ontologie, annotations
- Distributed data management and semantic integration
- Reasoning in open and distributed environments
- Multi-Agent-based modeling and programming
- Deciding in open and distributed systems
- Coordination models and technologies for autonomous agents
- Self-organizing systems
- Trust in multi-agent systems

The tight integration of **se**mantic, **re**asoning and **co**ordination technologies should lead to innovations in various application domains, including cyber-physical systems, enterprise information integration, sensor networks, manufacturing, industry 4.0, smart cities, ...

The SeReCo graduate school is carrying out the following actions:
- Annual internal workshops, alternatively in France and in Germany
- Summer schools in France and/or in Germany
- Jointly supervised PhD programs, including PhD courses
- Publication of internal reports, conference and journal papers, conference visits, and regular participation in joint seminars
